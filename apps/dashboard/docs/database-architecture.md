# Hebun — Database Strategy & Schema Architecture

> Phase 61. **Architecture only.** No installs, no migrations, no schema code, no
> behavior change. Target stack: **Supabase Postgres + Drizzle ORM**. Designed to
> reach millions of tenants and billions of audit/telemetry events without a
> redesign.

---

## 1. Grounding: current architecture

Design must fit what exists (phases 58–60), not replace it.

- **Command Bus** (`src/features/commands`): every primary action produces one
  `Command` — `id, traceId, commandType, source, actor, timestamp, context,
  payload, validationResult, policyResult, authorizationResult, approvalState,
  simulationState, auditRecord, telemetry, lifecycle[], status`. Deterministic,
  offline. Registry of self-declaring command types. Dispatcher is generic.
- **Persistence layer** (`src/features/persistence`): `PersistenceAdapter<T>`
  interface (`load/save/create/update/delete/restore/archive/exists/list/find/
  clear/subscribe/getSnapshot/transaction`). Memory adapter today. `storage-manager`
  is the single swap point. Every op audited (`PersistenceOperationRecord`) and
  counted.
- **Registry CRUD** (`src/features/registry-crud`): reference domain built on the
  adapter. Lifecycle status `active | archived | deleted` (soft delete). All
  mutations flow through the Command Bus.

**Invariant the DB must preserve:** UI → Service → Repository → **PersistenceAdapter**
→ Storage Provider. The database becomes a *provider behind the adapter*. Services,
repositories, Command Bus, and UI do not change when Postgres arrives — only a new
`SupabasePostgresAdapter` is added and selected in `storage-manager`.

---

## 2. Multi-tenant strategy

**Model: single Postgres, shared schema, row-level tenancy.** Chosen over
schema-per-tenant and db-per-tenant because it scales to millions of tenants with
one migration surface and one connection pool; isolation is enforced by RLS, not
by physical separation.

- **Company = tenant.** `tenants` (a.k.a. `companies`) is the root. `tenant_id uuid`
  is a **mandatory column on every domain row**, `NOT NULL`, FK → `tenants.id`.
- No cross-tenant foreign keys. Every FK stays inside one `tenant_id`.
- The `tenant_id` is the leading column of composite indexes and the partition key
  for high-volume tables.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| How is a Company represented? | `tenants` row (the tenant root); `organizations` optional sub-structure under a tenant |
| How are Users linked? | `users` ↔ `tenants` via `memberships(tenant_id, user_id, role_id)` (a user can belong to many tenants) |
| How are Departments linked? | `departments.tenant_id` + `departments.organization_id` |
| How are Agents linked? | `agents.tenant_id` (+ optional `department_id`) |
| How are Commands linked? | `commands.tenant_id` + `actor_user_id` |
| How are Memories linked? | `memories.tenant_id` (+ optional `agent_id`, `scope`) |
| How are Registries linked? | `registries.tenant_id` |

Global/system tables (command-type catalog, provider catalog, plan tiers) live in a
`platform` schema with **no** `tenant_id` — they are shared, read-only to tenants.

---

## 3. Domain model & entity ownership

Each entity has exactly one owning table/domain. Grouped by bounded context.

**Platform (no tenant_id, shared):**
- `command_types` — the command registry catalog (mirrors `features/commands/registry`)
- `providers` — provider catalog (Claude, Codex, GitHub, …)
- `plans` — subscription tiers

**Identity & tenancy:**
- `tenants` (company) · `organizations` · `departments` · `users` · `memberships`
  · `roles` · `permissions` · `role_permissions`

**Workforce & work:**
- `agents` · `workflows` · `tasks` · `executions` · `approvals`

**Data foundation:**
- `registries` · `registry_records` · `integrations`

**Governance:**
- `policies` · `risks` · `audit_log` (see §12) · `compliance_records`

**AI:**
- `conversations` · `messages` · `memories` · `knowledge_nodes` · `knowledge_edges`
  · `reasoning_traces` · `embeddings`

**Command Bus (event backbone):**
- `commands` · `command_lifecycle` · `command_audit` · `telemetry_events`
  · (future) `event_store`

**Product surface:**
- `documents` · `notifications` · `reports`

Ownership rule: a metric/label/dataset is written by exactly one table; every other
surface **references** it (mirrors the Phase 55–57 single-source-of-truth work).

---

## 4. Relationship map (high level)

```
tenants (1) ─┬─(∞) organizations ──(∞) departments ──(∞) agents
             ├─(∞) memberships ──(1) users        (∞)──ν
             │        └─(1) roles ──(∞) role_permissions ──(1) permissions
             ├─(∞) registries ──(∞) registry_records
             ├─(∞) workflows ──(∞) tasks ──(∞) executions
             ├─(∞) approvals
             ├─(∞) integrations ──(1) providers [platform]
             ├─(∞) policies / risks / compliance_records
             ├─(∞) conversations ──(∞) messages
             ├─(∞) memories ──(0..1) agents
             ├─(∞) knowledge_nodes ──(∞) knowledge_edges (node↔node, M:N)
             ├─(∞) reasoning_traces
             ├─(∞) embeddings ──(polymorphic owner_type/owner_id)
             └─(∞) commands ──(∞) command_lifecycle
                          ├──(∞) command_audit
                          └──(∞) telemetry_events
command_types [platform] (1) ──(∞) commands
```

- **One-to-many:** tenant→everything; workflow→tasks; conversation→messages.
- **Many-to-many:** users↔tenants (`memberships`); roles↔permissions
  (`role_permissions`); knowledge_nodes↔knowledge_nodes (`knowledge_edges`).
- **Polymorphic:** `embeddings.owner_type` + `owner_id` (memory | message |
  knowledge_node | document) — kept in one table so pgvector indexing is uniform.

---

## 5. Table strategy (columns every domain row carries)

Standard column contract (a Drizzle base mixin):

```
id            uuid   pk  default gen_random_uuid()
tenant_id     uuid   not null   fk → tenants(id)
created_at    timestamptz not null default now()
updated_at    timestamptz not null default now()   -- trigger-maintained
created_by    uuid   fk → users(id)       -- actor
lifecycle_status  enum('active','archived','deleted') not null default 'active'  -- soft delete
deleted_at    timestamptz null
version       integer not null default 1   -- optimistic concurrency / versioning
```

- **Soft delete only** — matches Registry CRUD. `lifecycle_status='deleted'` +
  `deleted_at`; rows are never hard-deleted. RLS + default views filter them out.
- **Versioning** — `version` bumps on update (optimistic locking); heavy domains
  (policies, workflows) get a companion `*_versions` history table (append-only).
- **Audit** — mutations mirror into `command_audit` (§12), never edited in place.

Constraints: `tenant_id NOT NULL` everywhere; per-tenant unique keys
(`unique(tenant_id, slug)`), never global unique on business keys; FK
`on delete restrict` (soft delete instead); check constraints on enums/status.

---

## 6. Index strategy

- **Every table:** composite `(tenant_id, id)` pk-adjacent + `(tenant_id, lifecycle_status)`
  partial index `where lifecycle_status='active'` (hot path lists active rows).
- **Lookup:** `unique(tenant_id, slug|name)` per domain.
- **Time-series (commands/audit/telemetry):** `(tenant_id, created_at desc)` +
  `(command_type, created_at desc)`; BRIN on `created_at` for partitioned append-only
  tables (cheap for billions of rows).
- **Foreign keys:** index every FK column (`department_id`, `workflow_id`, …).
- **JSONB payloads:** GIN index on `commands.payload` / `telemetry_events.data`
  only where queried; otherwise leave unindexed.
- **Vector:** HNSW index on `embeddings.vector` (pgvector) per `owner_type`.
- Avoid over-indexing write-heavy tables (commands/telemetry) — keep 2–3 indexes,
  rely on partition pruning.

---

## 7. Partition strategy

High-volume append-only tables are **declaratively partitioned**:

- `commands`, `command_audit`, `telemetry_events`, `messages`, `audit_log`:
  **range partition by `created_at`** (monthly), with **hash sub-partition by
  `tenant_id`** for the largest (telemetry, audit). Old partitions detach → cold
  storage / drop per retention policy.
- `embeddings`: partition by `owner_type` (memory / message / knowledge).
- Domain tables (agents, workflows, registries) stay unpartitioned until a tenant’s
  row count warrants list-partitioning by `tenant_id` bucket.
- Partition pruning on `tenant_id` + time range keeps queries O(one partition).

---

## 8. RLS strategy (tenant isolation)

Supabase Auth issues a JWT with `auth.uid()`. RLS is the isolation boundary.

- Helper: `current_tenant_ids()` = set of `tenant_id` from `memberships` where
  `user_id = auth.uid()` and membership active. Cached in a `SECURITY DEFINER`
  function.
- **Every tenant table:** `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + policies:
  - `SELECT`: `tenant_id in current_tenant_ids() and lifecycle_status <> 'deleted'`
  - `INSERT/UPDATE`: `tenant_id in current_tenant_ids()` + permission check
  - Hard delete: **no policy** (soft delete only).
- **Permission layer:** policies additionally check `has_permission(auth.uid(),
  tenant_id, 'agent.create')` via `role_permissions` — DB enforces what the
  Command Bus authorization stage decided.
- **Platform tables:** RLS allows read-all, write only to `service_role`.
- **Service role** (Edge Functions / server) bypasses RLS for system writes
  (telemetry ingestion), scoped by explicit `tenant_id`.

Result: a query without a valid tenant context returns zero rows — isolation is not
optional and not app-enforced.

---

## 9. Drizzle folder structure

`src/db/` — new, isolated; imported only by the future `SupabasePostgresAdapter`.

```
src/db/
  client.ts              -- drizzle(postgres) client (Supabase connection)
  schema/
    index.ts             -- re-exports all tables + relations
    _base.ts             -- shared columns mixin (id, tenant_id, timestamps, soft delete, version)
    _enums.ts            -- pg enums (lifecycle_status, command_status, approval_state, source…)
    tenant.ts            -- tenants, organizations, departments
    identity.ts          -- users, memberships, roles, permissions, role_permissions
    agent.ts             -- agents
    workflow.ts          -- workflows, tasks, executions
    registry.ts          -- registries, registry_records
    integration.ts       -- integrations (+ platform providers ref)
    command.ts           -- commands, command_lifecycle
    audit.ts             -- command_audit, audit_log
    telemetry.ts         -- telemetry_events
    governance.ts        -- policies, risks, approvals, compliance_records
    knowledge.ts         -- knowledge_nodes, knowledge_edges
    memory.ts            -- conversations, messages, memories
    reasoning.ts         -- reasoning_traces
    embedding.ts         -- embeddings (pgvector)
    product.ts           -- documents, notifications, reports
    platform.ts          -- command_types, providers, plans (no tenant_id)
  relations.ts           -- drizzle relations() graph
  rls/                   -- policy definitions (SQL, generated to migrations)
  migrations/            -- drizzle-kit output (later)
```

One domain per file, mirroring §3 bounded contexts. `_base.ts` guarantees every
tenant table carries the standard contract from §5.

---

## 10. Supabase usage — where each feature belongs

| Supabase feature | Use for |
|---|---|
| **Postgres** | All structured data — the tables above. Source of truth. |
| **Auth** | User identity, JWT with `auth.uid()`. Backs `users` + RLS. Future SSO/SAML via Auth providers. |
| **Storage** | Binary assets — documents, report exports, uploaded knowledge files. `documents.storage_path` points here; metadata stays in Postgres. |
| **Realtime** | Live UI updates — replaces the in-memory emitter. Subscribe to `commands`, `registry_records`, `notifications` filtered by `tenant_id`. Feeds `useSyncExternalStore`. |
| **RLS** | Tenant isolation + permission enforcement (§8). |
| **Edge Functions** | System writes that bypass UI: telemetry ingestion, scheduled reports, webhook receivers, Command Bus server-side execution when it goes online. Run as `service_role`. |
| **pgvector** | `embeddings.vector`; HNSW indexes for memory / knowledge / message semantic search. |

---

## 11. AI data (architect only — do not implement)

- **Conversation history:** `conversations` (tenant, agent, subject) → `messages`
  (role, content, token_count, created_at) — partitioned by time.
- **Memory:** `memories` (tenant, agent?, scope, kind: episodic|semantic|procedural,
  content, importance, source_command_id) — the persistent org memory layer already
  surfaced in `/director/memory`.
- **Knowledge Graph:** `knowledge_nodes` (tenant, type, ref) + `knowledge_edges`
  (from_node, to_node, relation, weight) — the `/director/knowledge-graph` surface.
- **Reasoning Graph:** `reasoning_traces` (tenant, command_id, stages jsonb,
  evidence[], confidence) — persists what the Reasoning Engine produces.
- **Embeddings / vector search:** single `embeddings` table, `vector(1536)` column,
  `owner_type/owner_id` polymorphic, HNSW index. Semantic retrieval over memory,
  knowledge, messages, documents.

All AI writes originate from commands, so they inherit tenant, actor, audit.

---

## 12. Command Bus → database mapping

The Command Bus is the write backbone. Nothing bypasses it.

```
Command (app)                         Postgres
──────────────                        ─────────
id, traceId, commandType, source,  →  commands (partitioned by created_at)
  actor(created_by), timestamp,
  context(jsonb), payload(jsonb),
  approvalState, status
lifecycle[]                        →  command_lifecycle (stage, status, detail, at)
auditRecord + validation/policy/   →  command_audit  (partitioned; append-only)
  authorization results
telemetry                          →  telemetry_events (partitioned; append-only)
(future) domain event              →  event_store  (append-only, replayable)
```

- `commands` is the intent + lifecycle record; the **domain mutation** (e.g. insert
  into `registries`) happens in the same DB transaction as the command insert, so a
  command and its effect commit or roll back together (the `transaction()` method
  already on the adapter interface).
- `command_audit` and `telemetry_events` are **append-only**, never updated — the
  immutable trail.
- `event_store` (future) enables full event-sourcing / replay without changing the
  dispatcher.

Persistence op audit (`PersistenceOperationRecord`) maps to a lightweight
`telemetry_events` sub-stream (`category='persistence'`).

---

## 13. Security

- **Tenant isolation:** RLS on `tenant_id` (§8) — the hard boundary.
- **Roles:** `roles` per tenant (Director, Operator, Auditor, …); `permissions`
  are command-type-scoped (`agent.create`, `approval.approve`, `registry.delete`).
- **Ownership:** `created_by` + department/agent ownership columns; row visibility
  can narrow below tenant via additional policies (e.g. Auditor read-only).
- **Future SSO:** Supabase Auth SAML/OIDC → maps external identity to `users`;
  membership/role assignment stays in `memberships`.
- **Secrets:** integration credentials never in Postgres columns — Supabase Vault /
  Edge Function env; tables store only references + status (matches current
  "no credentials stored" stance).

---

## 14. Scalability

- **Millions of companies:** shared schema + `tenant_id` partition key; connection
  pooling via Supabase/pgbouncer.
- **Write optimization:** append-only + partitioned commands/audit/telemetry; batch
  telemetry inserts via Edge Function; few indexes on write-hot tables.
- **Read optimization:** partial indexes on `active` rows; materialized views for
  dashboard rollups (company health, registry counts) refreshed on a schedule;
  Realtime for deltas instead of polling.
- **Future sharding:** shared-nothing by `tenant_id` — Citus (Supabase-compatible
  direction) distributes tenant tables by `tenant_id`, co-locating a tenant’s rows.
  The `tenant_id`-first design means no schema change to shard later.
- **Retention:** detach/drop old time-partitions; cold data → Storage/parquet.

---

## 15. Future migration strategy (in-memory → Postgres)

Zero application rewrite — the adapter contract is the seam.

1. Add `src/db/` schema (Drizzle) — no runtime change.
2. Implement `SupabasePostgresAdapter` satisfying `PersistenceAdapter<T>`
   (`list/find/create/update/archive/restore/delete/…` → SQL).
3. `storage-manager.getAdapter` selects provider by env
   (`ACTIVE_PROVIDER = 'supabase'`) per collection — one line.
4. Registry CRUD, Command Bus, services, UI **unchanged** (verified seam in P60).
5. Swap the in-memory emitter for Supabase Realtime inside the adapter's
   `subscribe`.
6. Migrate seed data via a one-time script; keep memory adapter for tests.

---

## 16. Recommended implementation order

1. `tenants`, `users`, `memberships`, `roles`, `permissions` + RLS helpers.
2. `commands`, `command_lifecycle`, `command_audit`, `telemetry_events` (the
   backbone — everything else writes through it).
3. `registries` + `registry_records` (port the reference domain first).
4. `SupabasePostgresAdapter` + `storage-manager` switch → cut Registry CRUD over.
5. `agents`, `workflows`, `tasks`, `executions`, `approvals`.
6. `integrations`, `policies`, `risks`, `compliance_records`.
7. AI: `conversations`, `messages`, `memories`, `knowledge_*`, `reasoning_traces`.
8. `embeddings` + pgvector + semantic search.
9. Partitioning + materialized rollups once volume grows.

---

## 17. Risks

- **RLS gaps** — a table shipped without `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` leaks across
  tenants. Mitigation: `_base.ts` + a CI check asserting RLS on every tenant table.
- **JSONB sprawl** — `payload`/`context` as unqueryable dumping grounds. Mitigation:
  promote frequently-queried fields to columns; GIN only where needed.
- **Partition mis-key** — partitioning by time but querying by tenant (or vice
  versa) kills pruning. Mitigation: composite time+tenant on the hottest tables.
- **pgvector cost** — HNSW builds are memory-heavy; embeddings volume explodes.
  Mitigation: partition by `owner_type`, cap dimensions, lazy-embed.
- **Migration drift** — in-memory and Postgres adapters diverging in semantics
  (e.g. soft-delete visibility). Mitigation: one shared adapter conformance test
  suite run against both.
- **Connection limits** — serverless + Postgres = pool exhaustion. Mitigation:
  Supabase pooler / pgbouncer, short-lived queries, Edge Functions for batch writes.
- **Over-partitioning early** — operational overhead before volume justifies it.
  Mitigation: start unpartitioned except commands/audit/telemetry; partition on
  measured growth.
